# Code for the experiments of the Doctoral Thesis
This repository contains the code for papers without restrictions due to the property rights of the datasets.
The repository contains a zip file, which once extracted produces two directories: vae and cvae. 

The vae directory contains the code for the paper: 
Lopez-Martin M, Carro B. and Sanchez-Esguevillas A., “Variational data generative model for intrusion detection”, Knowledge and Information Systems, December-2018. doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10115-018-1306-7 

The cvae directory contains the code for the paper:
Lopez-Martin M et al., “Conditional variational autoencoder for prediction and feature recovery applied to intrusion detection in IoT”. Sensors 17 (9), 2017. doi: https://doi.org/10.3390/s17091967
